@c @node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Code quality matters.

There is one rule above all others:

Be kind to the reader.

Several rules stem from this.
@itemize @bullet
@item
DRY - don't repeat yourself.
@item
If a method has grown longer than a hundred lines, break it apart,
with helper methods.
@item
Coupling of variables is a burden upon the reader.
Definitely stop once a class has two dozen attributes - break it up.
@end itemize

Continuous integration.

Always have a running system.

As a special case of this, always have Jenkins running your unit tests.

Measure code coverage of your tests.

To implement a new feature, first write a failing test.

When you notice you're unhappy with a computed result or an elapsed time,
first write a failing test which captures that behavior, then edit the
code until your test succeeds.


Refactor.

Parameterize.

Copy-n-paste has its place in the development process,
but not on the master branch, not in code that will be deployed.

When you implement functionality for closely related use cases,
you are presented with an opportunity, the use cases show where you
might usefully parameterize and generalize. Grasp the opportunity!
Do not let it pass you by.
